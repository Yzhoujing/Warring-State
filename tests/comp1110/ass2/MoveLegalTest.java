/**
 * Test objective:
 * <p>
 * Determine whether a given move is legal given a provided valid placement:
 * - the location char is in the range A .. Z or 0..9
 * - there is a card at the chosen location;
 * - the location is in the same row or column of the grid as Zhang Yi's current position; and
 * - drawing a line from Zhang Yi's current location through the card at the chosen location,
 * there are no other cards along the line from the same kingdom as the chosen card
 * that are further away from Zhang Yi.
