Review Comments:

1. Viewer.java:44 Could comment the origin of this cooridnate system (like the top-left is the origin of this coordinate system)
2. Viewer.java:49 x-axis
3. Viewer.java:55 y-axis
4. Viewer.java:71 the name of Text should be properly named
5. Viewer.java:73 the size of Text could be smaller so that some cards with long names could have its name fit properly in the frame
6. Viewer.java: makePlacement method is well-structured and appropriate but comments could be added for people who read to understand it better
7. Viewer.java: the font styles for cards from different kingdoms are consistent and colors of cards for different kingdoms are distinct. The sizes of texts are also changed based on the length of the names, but they could be improved.
